Programming Ideas and Thoughts
I'm a 52 year old new programmer. My focus is to learn programming with Python, develop my skills, and move on to Java and Android. I want to be able to make useful, and fun, applications in all the languages that I learn. I also want to develop my ability to be a problem solver. 
I read a lot and collect games. So, I want to make programs to inventory my books and games. I also want to create a few board games and Choose-Your-Own adventure games. I want to continue to make new versions of these applications as my programming skills improve. 
I would also like to learn enough to work as a programmer in the next few years and would like to develop some skill in Data Science.
